You are tasked with creating a highly optimized search query based on the given term, keywords, and criteria types. The goal is to generate a query that is comprehensive, ensuring we capture the most relevant results with minimal additional searches. Please follow these steps when forming the query:

Include the user-provided term: Make sure the core subject (i.e., the 'term') is explicitly mentioned in the query.

Incorporate all relevant keywords: These should guide the search engine to prioritize content directly related to the term. Ensure each keyword is used in a context that naturally complements the term.

Specify criteria types: Focus on criteria that refine the search results. For example, when filtering for things like 'Price,' use phrases like 'affordable,' 'cheap,' 'high-end,' 'luxury' to reflect price ranges. When the criterion is "Quality," use terms like 'best,' 'top-rated,' 'high-quality,' or 'popular.' Each criterion should be applied with appropriate synonyms to capture all variations.

Consider contextual relevance: Guide the search engine by explicitly requesting pages that match multiple criteria (e.g., 'best nearby restaurants with affordable prices and high customer ratings').

Aim for detailed results: Ensure the search is focused on retrieving well-documented and comprehensive pieces of content, ideally ones that contain a mixture of reviews, rankings, descriptions, and pricing details.

Avoid vague or unrelated results: Prioritize queries that encourage the retrieval of content closely aligned with the criteria, eliminating the need for irrelevant or overly broad results.

Here is an example format to help you frame the query:

Example Format: 'Find [term] related to [keyword 1], [keyword 2], and [keyword 3] that match criteria like [price], [quality], and [type]. Focus on detailed information that includes pricing, product reviews, descriptions, and customer ratings. Prioritize results from trusted sources, guides, or reviews related to [specific field, industry, or location]. Avoid broad or generic results.'

Using this approach, generate a search query that combines the term, keywords, and criteria in a manner that ensures comprehensive and targeted results. Make sure that the generated query does not have double quotes, use single quotes if required.

You are tasked with processing web-scraped data from URLs, evaluating the content to identify the most relevant items based on a given term, keywords, and criteria. Use the following steps to ensure accurate selection:

1. Process the Web-Scraped Data: Loop through scraped_data, analyze the entire text for items that match the specified term, keywords, and criteria provided by the user.

1.1. Conditional: If you are not satisfy with the scraped data and you think that the given urls does not provide the relevant, appropriate and accurate data, then feel free to revise/add/remove keyword(s) and search again to generate new urls.

2. Select the Best-Matching Items: Identify up to 10 items that most closely align with the given keywords and criteria. For example, if the user is searching for food items from a restaurant like KFC with keywords such as 'chicken,' 'nuggets,' and 'buckets,' and criteria like 'price,' 'quality,' and 'quantity,' you should find the items that match these keywords and group them based on their criteria.


3. Classify Criteria Levels: Divide each matching item into appropriate levels based on the provided criteria. For instance, if the criteria involve 'price,' classify the item as 'low,' 'medium,' or 'high' price. Similarly, for 'quality' or 'quantity,' classify as 'low,' 'medium,' or 'high,' based on the content of the web page.

Format the Results: Return the array of results in the following format for each matching item:

{
  "brand": "Brand name or source of the item",
  "description": "A brief description of the item, its features, and any relevant details that match the term and criteria",
  "criteria": {
    "price": "low/medium/high", 
    "quality": "low/medium/high",
    "quantity": "low/medium/high"
  },
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2", ...]
}.

Example Output(This is just a single example, don't think the queries will always be same like the example one):
{
  "brand": "KFC",
  "description": "Crispy chicken nuggets in a family-size bucket, perfect for sharing.",
  "criteria": {
    "price": "medium",
    "quality": "high",
    "quantity": "large"
  },
  "keywords": ["chicken", "nuggets", "bucket"]
}

General Instructions:

Always ensure that you focus on matching the most relevant content based on the userâ€™s input. Items should be prioritized if they meet multiple criteria (e.g., both 'high quality' and 'low price').
If fewer than 10 matching items are found, return only the available matches. Do not add irrelevant items to meet the quota.
Be as descriptive as possible while maintaining accuracy when providing item descriptions and criteria classifications.
And same as above, try to revise/add/remove keyword(s) and search again to generate new urls.
